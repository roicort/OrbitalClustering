Although it oﬀers no accuracy guarantees, its simplicity and speed are very appealing in practice. By augmenting k-means with a simple, randomized seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is O(log k)-competitive with the optimal clustering. Experiments show our augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite dramatically.},

The scandal ultimately led to a record-breaking \$5 billion penalty imposed upon Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in July 2019. The FTC action, however, has been criticized as failing to adequately address the privacy and other harms emanating from Facebook’s release of approximately 87 million Facebook users’ data, which was exploited without user authorization. This Essay summarizes the FTC’s response to the Cambridge Analytica–Facebook scandal. It concludes that the scandal focuses attention on the need to explore the potential for embedding due process-type inquiries and protections within the enforcement actions by regulatory agencies such as the FTC. These protections are increasingly important in addressing the problem of “black boxing the voter” that is now presented by data- and algorithmic-driven companies such as Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.},

	abstract = {Fake news can have a significant negative impact on society because of the growing use of mobile devices and the worldwide increase in Internet access. It is therefore essential to develop a simple mathematical model to understand the online dissemination of fake news. In this study, we propose a point process model of the spread of fake news on Twitter. The proposed model describes the spread of a fake news item as a two-stage process: initially, fake news spreads as a piece of ordinary news; then, when most users start recognizing the falsity of the news item, that itself spreads as another news story. We validate this model using two datasets of fake news items spread on Twitter. We show that the proposed model is superior to the current state-of-the-art methods in accurately predicting the evolution of the spread of a fake news item. Moreover, a text analysis suggests that our model appropriately infers the correction time, i.e., the moment when Twitter users start realizing the falsity of the news item. The proposed model contributes to understanding the dynamics of the spread of fake news on social media. Its ability to extract a compact representation of the spreading pattern could be useful in the detection and mitigation of fake news.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Twitter has been used to track trends and disseminate health information during viral epidemics. On January 21, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention activated its Emergency Operations Center and the World Health Organization released its first situation report about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), sparking significant media attention. How Twitter content and sentiment evolved in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been described.
            
            
              Methods
              We extracted tweets matching hashtags related to COVID-19 from January 14 to 28, 2020 using Twitter’s application programming interface. We measured themes and frequency of keywords related to infection prevention practices. We performed a sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment polarity and predominant emotions in tweets and conducted topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. We compared sentiment, emotion, and topics among the most popular tweets, defined by the number of retweets.
            
            
              Results
              We evaluated 126 049 tweets from 53 196 unique users. The hourly number of COVID-19-related tweets starkly increased from January 21, 2020 onward. Approximately half (49.5\%) of all tweets expressed fear and approximately 30\% expressed surprise. In the full cohort, the economic and political impact of COVID-19 was the most commonly discussed topic. When focusing on the most retweeted tweets, the incidence of fear decreased and topics focused on quarantine efforts, the outbreak and its transmission, as well as prevention.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Twitter is a rich medium that can be leveraged to understand public sentiment in real-time and potentially target individualized public health messages based on user interest and emotion.},

	abstract = {The 2015 General Election in the United Kingdom was the first to take place in the United Kingdom with Twitter as an important part of the social media landscape. This pilot project looked at 16 constituencies along England’s South Coast in order to investigate what impact, if any, Twitter had had on both the campaign and the result and to investigate the efficacy, or otherwise, of using Twitter as a tool for studying election campaigns in terms of candidate and local party activism. On the basis of an analysis of almost half a million tweets, the analysis concluded that there appeared to be a correlation between the rate at which parties and/or candidates responded to incoming tweets and their relative electoral performance but this was not demonstrable for all parties (it applied in particular to Labour and UK Independence Party candidates). In addition, high rates of reply also appeared to have a positive impact on constituency turnout figures. The findings are not yet conclusive but suggest that Twitter could be a good indicator of general levels of local party activism. The research also sought to understand how candidates used Twitter differently and established a number of candidate ‘classifiers’. It also investigated the issues agenda that was dominating Twitter conversations during the campaign and found that Twitter’s agenda was closer to the public’s than was that of the national media. The research also monitored the regional and local media in the 16 constituencies and discovered that their issues agenda was closer still to the public’s. Overall, it is difficult to conclude that Twitter had a major impact on the election campaign and result.},

The purpose of this paper is to perform empirical experiments using artiﬁcial datasets with controlled characteristics to assess how much cluster quality is lost when applying this algorithm.

For technical reasons, comparing large networks is computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, diameter, and relative graphlet frequency distribution have been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by simply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating their similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is computationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger the number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more likely it is that the networks will truly be similar.},

It has increasingly been popular in various disciplines such as mathematics and computer science. Furthermore, in quantum mechanics, quantum walks can be regarded as quantum analogues of classical random walks. Classical random walks and quantum walks can be used to calculate the proximity between nodes and extract the topology in the network. Various random walk related models can be applied in different ﬁelds, which is of great signiﬁcance to downstream tasks such as link prediction, recommendation, computer vision, semi-supervised learning, and network embedding. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of classical random walks and quantum walks. We ﬁrst review the knowledge of classical random walks and quantum walks, including basic concepts and some typical algorithms. We also compare the algorithms based on quantum walks and classical random walks from the perspective of time complexity. Then we introduce their applications in the ﬁeld of computer science. Finally we discuss the open issues from the perspectives of efﬁciency, main-memory volume, and computing time of existing algorithms. This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring random walks and quantum walks together.},

	abstract = {Graph embedding methods produce unsupervised node features from graphs that can then be used for a variety of machine learning tasks. Modern graphs, particularly in industrial applications, contain billions of nodes and trillions of edges, which exceeds the capability of existing embedding systems. We present PyTorch-BigGraph (PBG), an embedding system that incorporates several modiﬁcations to traditional multi-relation embedding systems that allow it to scale to graphs with billions of nodes and trillions of edges. PBG uses graph partitioning to train arbitrarily large embeddings on either a single machine or in a distributed environment. We demonstrate comparable performance with existing embedding systems on common benchmarks, while allowing for scaling to arbitrarily large graphs and parallelization on multiple machines. We train and evaluate embeddings on several large social network graphs as well as the full Freebase dataset, which contains over 100 million nodes and 2 billion edges.},

	abstract = {Embedding networks into a ﬁxed dimensional feature space, while preserving its essential structural properties is a fundamental task in graph analytics. These feature vectors (graph descriptors) are used to measure the pairwise similarity between graphs. This enables applying data mining algorithms (e.g classiﬁcation, clustering, or anomaly detection) on graph-structured data which have numerous applications in multiple domains. State-of-the-art algorithms for computing descriptors require the entire graph to be in memory, entailing a huge memory footprint, and thus do not scale well to increasing sizes of real-world networks. In this work, we propose streaming algorithms to eﬃciently approximate descriptors by estimating counts of sub-graphs of order k ≤ 4, and thereby devise extensions of two existing graph comparison paradigms: the Graphlet Kernel and NetSimile. Our algorithms require a single scan over the edge stream, have space complexity that is a fraction of the input size, and approximate embeddings via a simple sampling scheme. Our design exploits the trade-oﬀ between available memory and estimation accuracy to provide a method that works well for limited memory requirements. We perform extensive experiments on real-world networks and demonstrate that our algorithms scale well to massive graphs.},

These connections are indicators of content sharing, and network structures reflect patterns of information flow. This article proposes a conceptual and practical model for the classification of topical Twitter networks, based on their network-level structures. As current literature focuses on the classification of users to key positions, this study utilizes the overall network structures in order to classify Twitter conversation based on their patterns of information flow. Four network-level metrics, which have established as indicators of information flow characteristics—density, modularity, centralization, and the fraction of isolated users—are utilized in a three-step classification model. This process led us to suggest six structures of information flow: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, in and out hub-and-spoke networks. We demonstrate the value of these network structures by segmenting 60 Twitter topical social media network datasets into these six distinct patterns of collective connections, illustrating how different topics of conversations exhibit different patterns of information flow. We discuss conceptual and practical implications for each structure.},

	abstract = {Recent works on representation learning for graph structured data predominantly focus on learning distributed representations of graph substructures such as nodes and subgraphs. However, many graph analytics tasks such as graph classiﬁcation and clustering require representing entire graphs as ﬁxed length feature vectors. While the aforementioned approaches are naturally unequipped to learn such representations, graph kernels remain as the most effective way of obtaining them. However, these graph kernels use handcrafted features (e.g., shortest paths, graphlets, etc.) and hence are hampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec’s embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence, they could be used for any downstream task such as graph classiﬁcation, clustering and even seeding supervised representation learning approaches. Our experiments on several benchmark and large real-world datasets show that graph2vec achieves signiﬁcant improvements in classiﬁcation and clustering accuracies over substructure representation learning approaches and are competitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels.},

Its computational efﬁciency is superior to previous methods due to simpler sequence generation, and it produces more accurate results. In experiments, we found that the performance relative to other methods improves with increasing edge density in the graph.

In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the neural network interpretability research. We ﬁrst clarify the deﬁnition of interpretability as it has been used in many different contexts. Then we elaborate on the importance of interpretability and propose a novel taxonomy organized along three dimensions: type of engagement (passive vs. active interpretation approaches), the type of explanation, and the focus (from local to global interpretability). This taxonomy provides a meaningful 3D view of distribution of papers from the relevant literature as two of the dimensions are not simply categorical but allow ordinal subcategories. Finally, we summarize the existing interpretability evaluation methods and suggest possible research directions inspired by our new taxonomy.},

The identification of such roles provides key insight into the organization of networks and can be used for a variety of machine learning tasks. However, learning structural representations of nodes is a challenging problem, and it has typically involved manually specifying and tailoring topological features for each node. In this paper, we develop GraphWave, a method that represents each node’s network neighborhood via a low-dimensional embedding by leveraging heat wavelet diffusion patterns. Instead of training on hand-selected features, GraphWave learns these embeddings in an unsupervised way. We mathematically prove that nodes with similar network neighborhoods will have similar GraphWave embeddings even though these nodes may reside in very different parts of the network. GraphWave runtime scales linearly with the number of edges and experiments in a variety of different settings demonstrate GraphWave’s real-world potential for capturing structural roles in networks. All in all, GraphWave outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in every experiment, by as much as 137\%.},

In this work, we show that all of the aforementioned models with negative sampling can be unified into the matrix factorization framework with closed forms. Our analysis and proofs reveal that: (1) DeepWalk [31] empirically produces a low-rank transformation of a network’s normalized Laplacian matrix; (2) LINE [37], in theory, is a special case of DeepWalk when the size of vertices’ context is set to one; (3) As an extension of LINE, PTE [36] can be viewed as the joint factorization of multiple networks’ Laplacians; (4) node2vec [16] is factorizing a matrix related to the stationary distribution and transition probability tensor of a 2nd-order random walk. We further provide the theoretical connections between skip-gram based network embedding algorithms and the theory of graph Laplacian. Finally, we present the NetMF method1 as well as its approximation algorithm for computing network embedding. Our method offers significant improvements over DeepWalk and LINE for conventional network mining tasks. This work lays the theoretical foundation for skip-gram based network embedding methods, leading to a better understanding of latent network representation learning.},

	abstract = {Social media such as blogs, Facebook, Flickr, etc., presents data in a network format rather than classical IID distribution. To address the interdependency among data instances, relational learning has been proposed, and collective inference based on network connectivity is adopted for prediction. However, connections in social media are often multi-dimensional. An actor can connect to another actor for diﬀerent reasons, e.g., alumni, colleagues, living in the same city, sharing similar interests, etc. Collective inference normally does not diﬀerentiate these connections. In this work, we propose to extract latent social dimensions based on network information, and then utilize them as features for discriminative learning. These social dimensions describe diverse aﬃliations of actors hidden in the network, and the discriminative learning can automatically determine which aﬃliations are better aligned with the class labels. Such a scheme is preferred when multiple diverse relations are associated with the same network. We conduct extensive experiments on social media data (one from a real-world blog site and the other from a popular content sharing site). Our model outperforms representative relational learning methods based on collective inference, especially when few labeled data are available. The sensitivity of this model and its connection to existing methods are also examined.},

However, the existing methods are incapable of handling billion-scale networks, because they are computationally expensive and, at the same time, difﬁcult to be accelerated by distributed computing schemes. To address these problems, we propose RandNE (Iterative Random Projection Network Embedding), a novel and simple billion-scale network embedding method. Speciﬁcally, we propose a Gaussian random projection approach to map the network into a lowdimensional embedding space while preserving the high-order proximities between nodes. To reduce the time complexity, we design an iterative projection procedure to avoid the explicit calculation of the high-order proximities. Theoretical analysis shows that our method is extremely efﬁcient, and friendly to distributed computing schemes without any communication cost in the calculation. We also design a dynamic updating procedure which can efﬁciently incorporate the dynamic changes of the networks without error aggregation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efﬁciency and efﬁcacy of RandNE over state-of-the-art methods in several tasks including network reconstruction, link prediction and node classiﬁcation on multiple datasets with different scales, ranging from thousands to billions of nodes and edges.},

Here, we dispose of this distance-minimization assumption. Instead, we use the Laplacian matrix to find an embedding with geometric properties instead of spectral ones, by leveraging the so-called simplex geometry of G. We introduce a new approach, Geometric Laplacian Eigenmap Embedding (or GLEE for short), and demonstrate that it outperforms various other techniques (including Laplacian Eigenmaps) in the tasks of graph reconstruction and link prediction.

	abstract = {Embeddings have become a key paradigm to learn graph representations and facilitate downstream graph analysis tasks. Existing graph embedding techniques either sample a large number of node pairs from a graph to learn node embeddings via stochastic optimization, or factorize a high-order proximity/adjacency matrix of the graph via expensive matrix factorization. However, these techniques usually require significant computational resources for the learning process, which hinders their applications on largescale graphs. Moreover, the cosine similarity preserved by these techniques shows suboptimal efficiency in downstream graph analysis tasks, compared to Hamming similarity, for example. To address these issues, we propose NodeSketch, a highly-efficient graph embedding technique preserving high-order node proximity via recursive sketching. Specifically, built on top of an efficient dataindependent hashing/sketching technique, NodeSketch generates node embeddings in Hamming space. For an input graph, it starts by sketching the self-loop-augmented adjacency matrix of the graph to output low-order node embeddings, and then recursively generates k-order node embeddings based on the self-loop-augmented adjacency matrix and (k-1)-order node embeddings. Our extensive evaluation compares NodeSketch against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques using five real-world graphs on two graph analysis tasks. The results show that NodeSketch achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to these techniques, while showing significant speedup of 9x-372x in the embedding learning process and 1.19x-1.68x speedup when performing downstream graph analysis tasks.},

The learned low-dimensional node vectors ease the knowledge discovery on graphs by enabling various off-theshelf machine learning tools to be directly applied. Recent research has shown that the past decade of network embedding approaches either explicitly factorize a carefully designed matrix or are closely related to implicit matrix factorization, with the fundamental assumption that the factorized node connectivity matrix is low-rank. Nonetheless, the global low-rank assumption does not necessarily hold especially when the factorized matrix encodes complex node interactions, and the resultant single low-rank embedding matrix is insufﬁcient to capture all the observed connectivity patterns. In this regard, we propose a novel multi-level network embedding framework BoostNE, which can learn multiple node embeddings of different granularity from coarse to ﬁne without imposing the prevalent global low-rank assumption. The proposed BoostNE method is also in line with the successful gradient boosting method in ensemble learning. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BoostNE framework by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art network embedding methods on various datasets.},

This model learns low dimensional vectors to represent vertices appearing in a graph and, unlike existing work, integrates global structural information of the graph into the learning process. We also formally analyze the connections between our work and several previous research eﬀorts, including the DeepWalk model of Perozzi et al. [20] as well as the skip-gram model with negative sampling of Mikolov et al. [18] We conduct experiments on a language network, a social network as well as a citation network and show that our learned global representations can be eﬀectively used as features in tasks such as clustering, classiﬁcation and visualization. Empirical results demonstrate that our representation signiﬁcantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in such tasks.},

	abstract = {Random walks are at the heart of many existing node embedding and network representation learning methods. However, such methods have many limitations that arise from the use of traditional random walks, e.g., the embeddings resulting from these methods capture proximity (communities) among the vertices as opposed to structural similarity (roles). Furthermore, the embeddings are unable to transfer to new nodes and graphs as they are tied to node identity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Role2Vec framework based on the proposed notion of attributed random walks to learn structural role-based embeddings. Notably, the framework serves as a basis for generalizing any walk-based method. The Role2Vec framework enables these methods to be more widely applicable by learning inductive functions that capture the structural roles in the graph. Furthermore, the original methods are recovered as a special case of the framework when each vertex is mapped to its own function that uniquely identiﬁes it. Finally, the Role2Vec framework is shown to be effective with an average AUC improvement of 17.8\% for link prediction while requiring on average 853x less space than existing methods on a variety of graphs from different domains.},

	title = {Invariant embedding for graph classification},
	abstract = {Learning on graphs requires a graph feature representation able to discriminate among different graphs while being amenable to fast computation. The graph isomorphism problem tells us that no fast representation of graphs is known if we require the representation to be both invariant to nodes permutation and able to discriminate two non-isomorphic graphs. Most graph representations explored so far require to be invariant. We explore new graph representations by relaxing this constraint. We present a generic embedding of graphs relying on spectral graph theory called Invariant Graph Embedding (IGE). We show that for a large family of graphs, our embedding is still invariant. To evaluate the quality and utility of our IGE, we apply them to the graph classiﬁcation problem and show that IGE reaches the state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets.},
